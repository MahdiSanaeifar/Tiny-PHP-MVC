This is a Tiny project for those who have just learned `PHP` with `MVC` (Model,View,Controller) or who are looking for a
small and simple project to practice `PHP`

## Routing system

This simple Routing system working with controllers class name; for example when run myProject.ex/article/create, in
Controller directory create method opened in article class (it's run with NameSpace)
. [you can visit my routing system](https://github.com/MahdiSanaeifar/Tiny-PHP-MVC/blob/master/system/router/Routing.php)

## Traits

I used traits to have petter performance; this project have 2 trait file,

1. View/view: open file without require_once.
2. View/asset: for css,js,... to run path very easier.
3. View/include: open file without include.
4. View/url: for run urls very easier.
5. Redirect/redirect: move user to another page.
6. Redirect/back: move user redirect back.

## AutoLoad

autoloader func to run all class without call them.

## Config.php

set important parameters $base_url, $base_dir, $current_route, $dbHost, $dbName, $dbUsername, $dbPassword.
